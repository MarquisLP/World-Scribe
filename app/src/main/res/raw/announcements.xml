        <changelogtext>[b]Performance issues on Android 10 and above have been fixed![/b] A large
            portion of the app was rewritten to make navigation faster and prevent the app from
            freezing. Thank you for your patience in waiting for this update. Because this is a large
            update, you may encounter errors. If you do, please let us know in an email, with
            screenshots if possible, at: support@averistudios.com

        <changelogtext>[b]Please be aware that if you upgrade your device to Android 10 or Android
            11, the app may perform significantly slower.[/b] This is due to changes by Google in
            the Android operating system that make file operations much slower. We are currently
            working to improve this situation, but we ask that you please be patient as this will
            require significant changes throughout the entire app. We deeply apologize to users who
            are already impacted by these performance issues.
