        <changelogtext>[b]Please be aware that if you upgrade your device to Android 10 or Android
            11, the app may perform significantly slower.[/b] This is due to changes by Google in
            the Android operating system that make file operations much slower. We are currently
            working to improve this situation, but we ask that you please be patient as this will
            require significant changes throughout the entire app. We deeply apologize to users who
            are already impacted by these performance issues.
