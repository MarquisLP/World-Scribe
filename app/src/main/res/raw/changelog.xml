    <changelogversion versionName="1.6.0" changeDate="Jan 9, 2020">
        <changelogtext>Major changes have been made under-the-hood in order to comply with new
            Android policies. The app might take more time to open pages, particularly if your device
            runs Android 10 or above. We apologize for any inconvenience, but unfortunately, Android's
            new policies have made it so that our only option was a major code rewrite.
            The app has been tested thoroughly to ensure that everything behaves exactly the same as
            before. However, if you encounter any bugs, please don't hesitate to email us about it at:
            averistudios@gmail.com</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>You can now backup Worlds to NextCloud! To do so, open the menu on the
            top-right and select 'Backup to NextCloud'. [i]Thank you to tostc for this contribution.[/i]</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>Some issues in the German translation have been fixed.
            [i]Thank you to tostc for this contribution.[/i]</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>
    <changelogversion versionName="1.5.1" changeDate="Dec 7, 2019">
        <changelogtext>[b]German language support has been added![/b] The app's language will
            automatically switch if you have a German locale set as your primary in your device's
            system settings. [i]Thank you to tostc for this contribution.[/i]</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Faster and smoother scrolling in the Snippet page.[/b] Now you can reach
        the bottom of a Snippet with just a flick of your thumb!</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Bugfix: deleted folders for Connections, Snippets, and other sub-Article
            elements no longer cause errors.[/b] If you have a cleaning app, it may delete empty
            folders on your device. Prior to this update, this would cause problems, as a deleted
            Connections folder (for example) would prevent the app from making new Connections to
            an Article. With this update, those folders will automatically be recreated, so you
            don't have to worry about disabling or uninstalling anything in your cleaning apps.</changelogtext>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.5.0" changeDate="Aug 13, 2019">
        <changelogtext>[b]A new theme has been added: Chrome Gray![/b] Try combining it with
            Night Mode for a slick visual experience.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Menus have been reorganized![/b] By popular demand, [b]the 'Delete World'
        option has been moved to the Settings page[/b], so now you won't have to worry about
        accidentally deleting your creations. World-related options have also been removed from
        Article pages in order to reduce clutter.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Text and icons have been shrunken down to better scale with your device's
        font settings.[/b] Look at all the extra space you have to work with now! If you preferred
        the larger text size from previous versions, you can change it back via the font settings
        in your device's system settings.</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.7" changeDate="Jan 13, 2019">
        <changelogtext>Want to help us make future versions of World Scribe even
            better? [b]You can now fill out the user survey [a
            href="https://goo.gl/forms/3VAhRuAajgBKmXyY2"]here[/a]![/b]
            You can also access the survey by opening the overflow menu on the top-right and
            selecting "Feedback".</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.6" changeDate="Aug 25, 2018">
        <changelogtext>[b]Fixed one of the Dropbox issues![/b] This one was caused
            by an invalid Dropbox "access token" (a small record stored on your
            device that tells Dropbox your account info is valid). If you were one
            of the users affected by this issue, then when you try to upload again,
            the app will ask you to reauthenticate. If you do so, then the old
            access token will be replaced by a new one, allowing you to upload your
            Worlds without any further problems.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Some major behind-the-scenes improvement to how
            Dropbox uploading works.[/b] As a user, you won't see much of a
            difference, but rest assured the new uploading method is more robust and
            should make problems less likely and easier to troubleshoot in the
            future.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]More Dropbox bug fixes to come![/b] The fix above doesn't
            apply to all errors that users have sent in. If you are still facing
            Dropbox issues after this update, please be patient as we work on
            a resolution. In the meantime, you can help us out by trying to upload,
            and then sending the error log when prompted.</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.5.a" changeDate="Aug 19, 2018">
        <changelogtext>[b]Added more Dropbox error logging improvements.[/b] We will continue
            to release logging improvements until the Dropbox upload issue has been resolved, so
            please try to keep the app updated. Again, if you are still experiencing issues with
            Dropbox uploading, please try to upload again, and then send the error log when
            prompted. Thank you for your co-operation.</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.5" changeDate="Aug 15, 2018">
        <changelogtext>[b]Improved error logging for Dropbox issues.[/b] If you are
            experiencing issues with uploading to Dropbox, please try uploading again,
            and then send the error log when prompted. The sooner we can identify
            what is causing this issue, the sooner we can fix it.</changelogtext>
    </changelogversion>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.4" changeDate="Jul 17, 2018">
