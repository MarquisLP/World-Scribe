    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.6" changeDate="Aug 25, 2018">
        <changelogtext>[b]Fixed one of the Dropbox issues![/b] This one was caused
            by an invalid Dropbox "access token" (a small record stored on your
            device that tells Dropbox your account info is valid). If you were one
            of the users affected by this issue, then when you try to upload again,
            the app will ask you to reauthenticate. If you do so, then the old
            access token will be replaced by a new one, allowing you to upload your
            Worlds without any further problems.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]Some major behind-the-scenes improvement to how
            Dropbox uploading works.[/b] As a user, you won't see much of a
            difference, but rest assured the new uploading method is more robust and
            should make problems less likely and easier to troubleshoot in the
            future.</changelogtext>
        <changelogtext>[b]More Dropbox bug fixes to come![/b] The fix above doesn't
            apply to all errors that users have sent in. If you are still facing
            Dropbox issues after this update, please be patient as we work on
            a resolution. In the meantime, you can help us out by trying to upload,
            and then sending the error log when prompted.</changelogtext>

    <changelogversion versionName="1.4.5.a" changeDate="Aug 19, 2018">
        <changelogtext>[b]Added more Dropbox error logging improvements.[/b] We will continue
            to release logging improvements until the Dropbox upload issue has been resolved, so
            please try to keep the app updated. Again, if you are still experiencing issues with
            Dropbox uploading, please try to upload again, and then send the error log when
            prompted. Thank you for your co-operation.</changelogtext>

            what is causing this issue, the sooner we can fix it.</changelogtext>
