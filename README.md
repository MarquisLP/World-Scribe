## Overview
Ever wanted to create a fictional setting — for your next novel, comic, screenplay, or what-have-you — but find it difficult to keep everything organized?

World Scribe eases the creation process by letting you keep track of every important element in your world, including the ways in which they're connected.
## Features
* World elements — known as **Articles** — can be organized into five categories for your convenience:
    * People
    * Groups
    * Places
    * Items
    * Concepts
* Any Article can possess **Connections** to other Articles, complete with relationship descriptions. Each Connection also acts as a link to that Article's page. Need to find a character's siblings, or the ancient artifacts on their person? You can navigate to each of them straight from that character's page. 
* Any Article can also possess **Snippets**, which are custom text entries unique to that Article. Want to write down an important letter or speech from one of your characters? How about a song or poem warning of a dangerous location in the world? The possibilities are endless!
* Everything you write is stored in simple text files on external storage, so feel free to export your worlds at any time and use them in other writing projects.

## How to Use
Simply create a fork or download the repo zip and open up the project in Android Studio.

Ensure that you have the Android Support libraries installed and updated to the latest version.
